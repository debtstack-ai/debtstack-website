## API Keys

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl "https://api.debtstack.ai/v1/companies" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ds_xxxxx"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

### Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [debtstack.ai](https://debtstack.ai)
2. Go to your [Dashboard](https://debtstack.ai/dashboard)
3. Copy your API key from the API Keys section

### Key Format

API keys follow the format `ds_` followed by 32 hexadecimal characters:

```
ds_a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678abcdef12
```

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are applied per API key based on your tier:

| Tier | Rate Limit | Requests |
|------|------------|----------|
| Free | 10/min | 25/day |
| Pro | 120/min | Unlimited |
| Business | Custom | Unlimited |

### Rate Limit Headers

Every response includes rate limit information:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 120
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 115
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706140800
```

### Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Retry after 30 seconds.",
    "details": {
      "retry_after": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Check the `Retry-After` header for when you can retry.

## Credit System

API calls consume credits based on the endpoint complexity:

| Endpoint | Credits |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /v1/companies` | 1 |
| `GET /v1/bonds` | 1 |
| `GET /v1/bonds/resolve` | 1 |
| `GET /v1/pricing` | 1 |
| `GET /v1/companies/{ticker}/changes` | 2 |
| `POST /v1/entities/traverse` | 3 |
| `GET /v1/documents/search` | 3 |
| `POST /v1/batch` | Sum of operations |

### Checking Credit Balance

```bash
curl "https://api.debtstack.ai/v1/auth/me" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ds_xxxxx"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "tier": "pro",
  "credits": {
    "remaining": 45000,
    "monthly_limit": 50000,
    "resets_at": "2026-02-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, not in code:

    ```python
    import os
    API_KEY = os.environ.get("DEBTSTACK_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    You can regenerate your API key from the dashboard. The old key will be immediately invalidated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    Check your usage regularly in the dashboard to detect any unauthorized access.
