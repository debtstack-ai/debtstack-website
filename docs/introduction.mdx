# Welcome to DebtStack

Corporate structure and debt analysis is complex. Even with AI, achieving accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness requires significant engineering. DebtStack does this hard work once, giving you instant API access to pre-computed, quality-assured credit data.

## The Problem

Extracting accurate corporate structure and debt data from SEC filings is surprisingly hard:

- **Accuracy challenges**: LLMs return malformed JSON, misinterpret amounts, confuse entity names
- **Speed variability**: A single extraction can take 90-300 seconds with multiple LLM calls
- **Cost uncertainty**: Ad-hoc extraction costs $0.03-0.50+ per company
- **Expertise required**: Understanding 10-K structure, Exhibit 21, debt footnotes, VIEs

**The Solution**: DebtStack runs extraction once with rigorous QA, then serves pre-computed data via fast API.

## Current Database

**201 companies | 5,374 entities | 3,056 debt instruments | 591 with CUSIP/ISIN | 13,862 document sections | 3,831 guarantees | 626 collateral records**

    params={
        "ticker": "AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,AMZN,NVDA,META,TSLA",
        "fields": "ticker,name,net_leverage_ratio",
        "sort": "-net_leverage_ratio",
        "limit": 1
    },
    headers={"X-API-Key": "ds_xxxxx"}
)

print(response.json())
# {"data": [{"ticker": "TSLA", "name": "Tesla, Inc.", "net_leverage_ratio": 1.8}]}
```

## 9 Core Primitives

DebtStack offers 9 atomic API endpoints optimized for AI agents:

| Primitive | Endpoint | Credits | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Search Companies | `GET /v1/companies` | 1 | Filter by leverage, sector, 15+ filters |
| Search Bonds | `GET /v1/bonds` | 1 | Find by yield, seniority, maturity |
| Resolve Bond | `GET /v1/bonds/resolve` | 1 | Map CUSIP/ISIN or free-text to bond |
| Financials | `GET /v1/financials` | 1 | Quarterly income, balance, cash flow |
| Collateral | `GET /v1/collateral` | 1 | Collateral securing debt |
| Company Changes | `GET /v1/companies/{ticker}/changes` | 2 | Track debt structure changes |
| Traverse Entities | `POST /v1/entities/traverse` | 3 | Follow guarantor chains |
| Search Documents | `GET /v1/documents/search` | 3 | Full-text search SEC filings |
| Batch | `POST /v1/batch` | Sum | Execute multiple operations |

## Data Quality

**Estimated data is always flagged.** When data cannot be extracted and must be inferred:

- `issue_date_estimated: true` - Issue date inferred from maturity date
- Future estimated fields follow the same pattern

## Data Freshness

DebtStack extracts directly from the latest SEC EDGAR filings, providing **12-18 months fresher data** than LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini.

| Source | Data Period | NVDA EBITDA Example |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **DebtStack** | Nov 2025 (FY2026 Q3) | $121B |
| Gemini/ChatGPT | Q1 2025 (knowledge cutoff) | $39B |
