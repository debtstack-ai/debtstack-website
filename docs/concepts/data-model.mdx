## Data Conventions

### Monetary Values

All monetary values are stored in **cents** (hundredths of a dollar) to avoid floating-point precision issues.

| Value | Cents |
|-------|-------|
| $1.00 | 100 |
| $1 million | 100,000,000 |
| $1 billion | 100,000,000,000 |

Example: `total_debt: 9500000000000` = $95 billion

### Interest Rates

Interest rates are stored as **percentages** (not basis points) for readability.

| Value | Storage |
|-------|---------|
| 5.75% | 5.75 |
| 8.50% | 8.50 |
| SOFR + 200bps | spread_bps: 200 |

### Dates

All dates use **ISO 8601** format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

```json
{
  "issue_date": "2023-01-15",
  "maturity_date": "2028-01-15"
}
```
